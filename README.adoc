# longhorn-product-docs

SUSE product documentation for Longhorn

## Local working

* Clone the repository.
* Run `make environment` to install antora.
* Run `make after_clone` to setup all the remote branches for local working.
* Run `make local` to build the site into `build/site`. Open `build/local/index.html` to view.

## Versions

Versioned docs are in git branches. The `main` branch has no content, just
playbooks and Makefile. Content is only in the branches, for example `1.8.0`.

To work on a branch, switch to it, for example `git switch 1.8.0`. Do the work
then construct a PR to merge into the branch, for example, `origin/1.8.0`. Do
not merge branch work into `main`.

Good luckâ€½
